# 2023 PACE NSC Streaming Util
This is a utility designed to help run the livestream of gameplay for the 2023 PACE NSC, as well as future streams of Quizbowl tournaments.
It is meant to be used alongside the OBS Studio software, with the use of a few additional plugins.

## Dependencies
This project utilizes HTML-GL, HTML, and TypeScript. It is currently in version 0.0.1, and I plan to extend its functionality
for future uses.

## Installation
First, install [OBS Studio]. Then, clone this project to an easily-accessible location.
Finally, install the Dockable Lower-Thirds Tool (authored by NAME HERE), and ensure that 
it is set up within OBS. After that, you're good to go!

## Features
A few key parts of the software:

* Shaders that incorporate team / school colors
* Indicators for buzzes and point values on tossups and bonuses
* Showing which team controls a given bonus or bounceback
* Custom shaders for waiting screens between games and for added flair during gameplay
* Integration with MODAQ to show dynamic score updates

Suggestions are welcome and highly appreciated! Please send them to S. A. Shenoy (sshenoy [at] pace-nsc [dot] org).

Best of luck to all teams at this year's NSC~
